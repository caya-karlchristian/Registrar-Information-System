    // every single test, only the first migrate:fresh of the run).

    // DatabaseSeeder::run() does NOT call LocalDevSeeder at all — that
    // seeder is invoked only from start.sh at container boot, never from
    // the db:seed path this triggers — so this does NOT create the fake
    // local dev accounts/sample data in the testing environment, only
    // the reference tables every feature test actually depends on. See
    // DatabaseSeeder::run()'s docblock for why an env-var guard inside
    // the seeder call itself wasn't a reliable enough boundary on its own.
