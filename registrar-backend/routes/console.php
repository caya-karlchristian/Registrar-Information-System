| BUG FIX (client-side auto-forfeit race condition, found while
| investigating QA #12):
|
| useStaffDashboard.js used to compute "90+ days old" client-side and
| fire a real forfeit write directly from the dashboard's poll — on
| EVERY staff member's browser, every 30s, for every stale request. Two
| distinct problems: (1) N dashboards open == N racing writes for the
| same request with no lock, and (2) it used the wrong clock entirely
| (requested_at — creation time — instead of the most recent transition
| into ReadyToClaim), a silently-diverging definition of the same
| business rule this command already gets right.
|
| That client-side stand-in only existed because this job ran once a
| day, so staff would otherwise see a stale ReadyToClaim request for up
| to ~24h after it should have been forfeited. Rather than patch the
| symptom (add a lock, fix the date math client-side, keep two
| implementations in sync forever), the fix is to make the one correct,
| already-transactional, already-audited, already-cache-invalidated
| implementation (this command) run often enough that no client-side
| stand-in is needed at all — exactly the precedent already set below
| by role-assignments:expire for the identical "daily cadence leaves
| stale status visible too long" problem.
|
| Order still matters relative to the other 08:xx jobs:
|   08:00  (kept, redundant with hourly() below, harmless)
|   08:05  SendUnclaimedReminders  — send 7-day warnings for the rest.
|
| withoutOverlapping() — prevents a slow DB run from spawning a duplicate.
| runInBackground()    — keeps the scheduler process non-blocking.
| appendOutputTo()     — tails in storage/logs/scheduler.log.

// BUG FIX (RIS-PROCESS-BUGS #5 — "Role Status Remains 'Active' Past
// Expiration Date and Time"):
//
// This was previously ->dailyAt('08:20'), so an expired role assignment's
// Sanctum tokens stayed alive — and its audit-log/ROLE_EXPIRED entry stayed
// unwritten — for up to ~24h after expires_at elapsed. The *display* half
// of this bug (the Manage Roles modal showing a stale "Active" badge) is
// fixed independently and immediately via RoleAssignment::effectiveStatus()
// / RoleAssignmentResource (no longer depends on this job's cadence at
// all). This schedule change addresses the other half: how long an
// expired grant's actual SESSION (Sanctum tokens) and audit trail lag
// behind reality.
//
// Hourly (not, say, every minute) is a deliberate balance: expires_at
// values in practice are set to day/term boundaries, not second-level
// precision, so sub-hour freshness has no real-world payoff here, while
// hourly keeps the query cheap (indexed, typically an empty or tiny result
// set — see RoleAssignment::scopeDueToExpire()) and keeps this job well
// clear of the other 08:xx jobs' overlap window. withoutOverlapping()
// still guards against a slow run stacking with the next tick.

| spec — it only asked for the command to exist "for CI/cron alerting" —
| but a tamper-evidence mechanism nobody is checking is a mechanism that
| catches tampering only when someone happens to remember to run it by
| hand. Cheap (single ordered read of the table) and high-value to run
| unattended; wire the non-zero exit code into your monitoring/alerting
| the same way break-glass:test already implies below.
