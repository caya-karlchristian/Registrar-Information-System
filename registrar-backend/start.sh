# Migrations are intentionally NOT run here.
#
# This container's CMD runs on every boot: initial deploy, container
# restart, host reboot, `docker compose up` on an unchanged image, etc.
# Running `php artisan migrate` on every one of those was racing against
# the deploy pipeline's own explicit `php artisan migrate --force --isolated`
# step (see .github/workflows/deploy.yml, which now runs that step as a
# disposable one-off container BEFORE `docker compose up -d` even starts
# this container). Regardless of ordering relative to `up -d`, this
# script must never also invoke `migrate` — two concurrent, unlocked
# `migrate` runs against the same database is a real race (observed in
# production: "Table 'fulfillment_track' already exists", both runs
# passing Schema::hasTable() before either committed its Schema::create()).
#
# The previous `|| true` on this line made it worse by silently
# swallowing genuine migration failures on every boot.
#
# Migrations now run exactly once per deploy, explicitly, from the CI
# pipeline, with Laravel's --isolated flag (atomic lock via the redis
# cache store) as defense-in-depth against any future double-run. If a
# migration is pending when this container boots, the app will surface
# that as a real error (e.g. missing column) instead of silently
# racing/masking it — which is the correct failure mode: it means the
# deploy pipeline's migrate step didn't run or didn't finish, and that
# needs to be visible, not papered over here.

# Clear and cache config — but never in local dev. Caching bakes the
# current env vars (including APP_ENV) into bootstrap/cache/config.php,
# and once that cache exists Laravel reads config/env values from that
# frozen snapshot for the rest of the container's life — it stops
# consulting actual environment variables at all. That's harmless in
# prod/staging (env vars don't change without a redeploy anyway), but
# in local dev it's actively harmful: docker-compose.local.yml sets
# APP_ENV=local at container boot, so caching here permanently bakes
# in 'local', and no later override (e.g. `docker compose exec backend
# php artisan test`, which needs APP_ENV=testing) can ever take effect
# without an explicit config:clear — regardless of what phpunit.xml
# says. This previously caused LocalDevSeeder to run during `php
# artisan test` (its app()->environment('local') / runningUnitTests()
# guards both read the same poisoned cached value) and seed 4 fixed
# accounts into the test database, silently inflating count-based
# assertions in RoleAssignmentSearchTest, AlumniProvisioningTest, and
# UserProvisioningServiceTest. Local dev also doesn't need the
# performance win config caching exists for, since this compose file
# bind-mounts source for live reload anyway.

# Seed base reference data (roles, access_type, programs, policies,

# Local dev uses a disposable MySQL volume, so unlike staging/prod —
# which already carry this data from real history and only ever run
# `php artisan migrate --force` in their deploy workflows — a fresh
# local database has empty reference tables after `migrate` alone.
# LocalDevSeeder assumes these rows already exist (e.g. it inserts
# users with role_id values that must already be present in `roles`,
# or the insert fails on the fk_users_role constraint). Every row
# DatabaseSeeder::run() writes goes through updateOrInsert, so this is
# safe and cheap to run on every local boot, not just the first one.

# never re-execs start.sh). That makes this structurally safe regardless
# of how APP_ENV or any other env var resolves inside a test process; see
# DatabaseSeeder::run() for the full history of why an env-var guard
# inside the seeder itself wasn't reliable enough on its own.
