/**
 * FESPEC-0008 — Free Document/Certificate Request.
 *
 * Answers exactly one question — "may $targetUser receive $typeId for
 * free, right now, through the admin_filed_free channel?" — for a
 * single (kind, typeId) pair. Deliberately free of side effects (no
 * writes, no locking, no Auth:: calls): FreeRequestService::
 * fileFreeRequest() is what wraps a call to check() inside a row-locked
 * transaction at the moment of filing (see that class's docblock for
 * why the lock lives there and not here). Keeping this class pure is
 * also exactly what the Phase 6 test plan calls for — every case in
 * that plan (eligible graduate, ineligible document type, non-graduate,
 * already-claimed graduate, filed-then-forfeited graduate, LOA with
 * prior claimed LOA) is a plain input/output assertion against check()
 * with no database transaction or mocking required beyond factory rows.
 *
 * ── Rule 1 — is_free_eligible ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The type must have is_free_eligible = true. This is the opt-in gate:
 * a type with no configured free_issuance_limit is NOT "unlimited by
 * omission" — it simply isn't part of this feature at all (see the
 * Phase 1 migration's docblock).
 *
 * ── Rule 2 — role visibility ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The type's access_id must already be visible to the TARGET account's
 * actual role (App\Enums\AccessType::studentVisibleIds() /
 * alumniVisibleIds() — the same single source of truth
 * CashierDocumentSuggester already uses for the self-service forms).
 * Deliberately reads $targetUser->role_id directly rather than
 * SystemUser::isStudent()/isAlumni() — those resolve the CURRENTLY
 * AUTHENTICATED SESSION's assumed role (see SystemUser::
 * assumedRoleId()'s docblock), which is meaningless here: the target
 * account being looked up by a staff member is never the session
 * making this call.
 *
 * ── Rule 3 — graduate-scoped types require the Alumni role ─────────────
 * A type with a finite free_issuance_limit (i.e. NOT NULL) is, by
 * construction, a First-Copy-Free-Issuance-for-Graduates type — TOR and
 * COG are seeded with free_issuance_limit = 1 specifically because that
 * policy's scope (§2) is graduates only, one-time. A type with
 * free_issuance_limit = NULL (LOA) is instead governed by the base Free
 * Documents/Certificates Request Policy alone, which has no graduate
 * restriction — LOA is visible to (and requestable by) currently
 * enrolled students per its own access_id = 1.
 *
 * This couples "has a finite limit" to "is graduate-scoped" rather than
 * hardcoding document_type_id/certificate_type_id checks for COG/TOR
 * specifically, so a future type added to this feature is correctly
 * classified purely by how its two Phase-1 columns are configured — no
 * code change needed. ASSUMPTION FLAGGED FOR CONFIRMATION: this
 * couples two concepts (issuance limit vs. graduate-only restriction)
 * that happen to align for every type in scope today, but are not
 * logically identical — if a future policy ever needs a capped-but-not-
 * graduate-restricted type, this rule must be revisited (e.g. an
 * explicit requires_graduate_verification column). Flagged explicitly
 * rather than silently assumed.
 *
 * ── Rule 4 — consumption count vs. limit ────────────────────────────────
 * Counts this target's own prior Completed admin_filed_free requests
 * for this exact type (see DocumentRequest::scopeAdminFiledFree() and
 * RequestStatusEnum::Completed — the real "successfully claimed"
 * terminal state; there is no separate "claimed" status). A prior
 * request that was Forfeited (expired, never claimed) or is still
 * Processing/ReadyToClaim does NOT count against the limit — this is
 * the revised "consumed upon claim, not upon filing" rule, and is what
 * lets a graduate whose first attempt lapsed unclaimed file again
 * without being permanently blocked. free_issuance_limit = NULL (LOA)
 * skips this count entirely — always eligible on this rule.
