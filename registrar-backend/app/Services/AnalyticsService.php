        //      doc block) — so a request that sat untouched for days before
        //      an admin finally moved it gets that entire wait attributed to
        //      that admin, like a relay runner timed for the whole race
        //      instead of just their leg. business_minutes is the additive,

        //      backfill needed, it just wasn't being read here yet.
        //
        //      business_minutes is also calendar-aware (office hours only,
        //      excludes weekends/holidays), which is what we want for a
        //      staff performance number: it doesn't penalize an admin for a
        //      request sitting overnight, only for time they actually held
        //      it during business hours.
        //
        //      whereNotNull('rh.business_minutes') below also takes care of
        //      "reset old records": business_minutes was added as a nullable
        //      column and is NULL on any history row written before that
        //      migration, so those rows simply drop out of this average
        //      instead of polluting it with the old cumulative numbers.
        //
        //   2. requests_handled counts COUNT(DISTINCT rh.request_id), not
        //      COUNT(*). Every request logs one history row per status
        //      transition, so COUNT(*) credited an admin once per step
        //      instead of once per request — a single 4-step request handled
        //      by one admin end-to-end was counted as 4 "requests handled".

        // Plan Step 1a — min_minutes / max_minutes / sample_count added here,
