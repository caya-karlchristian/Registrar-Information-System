/**
 * Records rows to security_events and — for failed local-auth logins —
 * turns a burst of them into a live SuperAdmin notification.
 *
 * This is the class that closes the gap explicitly deferred in
 * LocalAuthController's original NOTE comment: LocalAuthService::attempt()
 * already Log::warning()'d every failed attempt, but nothing turned a
 * burst of those warnings into an alert. This does both — persists the
 * event (queryable, survives container recreation, unlike storage/logs)
 * and, once a threshold is crossed, notifies.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT hash-chained like AuditLogger — see SecurityEvent's
 * docblock. No transaction/row-lock dance is needed here either: unlike
 * AuditLogger's hash chain (where two concurrent writes reading the same
 * prev_hash would corrupt the chain), each security_events row is
 * independent, so ordinary auto-increment inserts are safe under
 * concurrency.
 *
 * Registered as a singleton in AppServiceProvider, same as AuditLogger.
