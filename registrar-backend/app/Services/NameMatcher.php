/**
 * NameMatcher
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this class's role changed shape during design once a real
 * API constraint was discovered; read this before touching it.
 *
 * The original design was "compare RIS's submitted name against the
 * Cashier's on-file name after a failed lookup, and rescue near-misses."
 * That's not buildable: per the Cashier System API doc, a NOT_FOUND
 * response is exactly `{"valid": false, "reason": "NOT_FOUND"}` — no
 * `data`, no on-file name — and a wrong name vs. a wrong OR number
 * return that identical shape. RIS never receives the name that's
 * actually on file when a lookup fails, so there is nothing to
 * fuzzy-compare against after the fact.
 *
 * What's actually buildable instead: generate several plausible
 * formattings of the same person's name from data RIS already has (the
 * student/alumni profile), and let the caller retry verifyPayment() with
 * each candidate until one succeeds or all are exhausted. This works
 * because the Cashier API is a live, repeatable endpoint we can call
 * more than once — the compensating control is "try harder," not
 * "second-guess the API's answer."
 *
 * Why this is needed at all
 * -------------------------
 * The Cashier System's "Customer Name" field is free text (confirmed via
 * screenshot of the live payment form, 2026-08-11) — the placeholder
 * "LAST NAME, FIRST NAME M.I." is a hint, not an enforced format.
 * Nothing stops a cashier admin from typing a full middle name, dropping
 * it entirely, reordering it, or attaching a suffix to the last name
 * instead of the given names. RIS's own formatCustomerName() produces one
 * specific format (middle initial, no full middle name — fixed
 * 2026-08-11 for the same reason). If the admin's on-file string uses a
 * different convention than the one RIS guesses, the OR is real and paid
 * but verification still fails.
 *
 * Design
 * ------
 * Candidates are ordered from most- to least-likely, and the caller
 * should stop at the first one that returns valid:true (see
 * DocumentRequestController::store()). The OR number itself is never
 * varied — it's the real credential (single-use enforced, not
 * practically guessable). Only the name formatting is guessed, because
 * that's the only piece a free-text form makes unreliable.
 *
 * This class does not call the API, log anything, or decide pass/fail —
 * it only generates candidate strings. The caller owns the retry loop
 * and the audit trail.
 *
 * Safety cap
 * ----------
 * Every candidate this method returns is a live call to a third-party
 * API in the caller's retry loop. MAX_CANDIDATES bounds that regardless
 * of how many variant dimensions get added over time (suffix placement,
 * punctuation, word order, ...), so a future well-intentioned addition
 * can't silently turn a handful of API calls into dozens per submission.
 * Entries are pruned from the *end* of the priority-ordered list, so the
 * most-likely formats are always kept.
 */

    /**
     * Generate plausible name-string candidates for the same person,
     * most-likely-correct first.
     *
     * Confirmed 2026-08-11: the Cashier System's "Customer Name" field is
     * free text an admin types by hand, and the "LAST NAME, FIRST NAME
     * M.I." placeholder on its own form is not enforced — one real OR was
     * on file simply as "Floresca Duvan" (no comma at all, not even
     * following its own form's convention). Since the admin's format
     * can't be predicted and the cashier team can't change how they enter
     * names, RIS compensates by trying multiple plausible formats rather
     * than one "correct" one.
     *
     * Confirmed 2026-08-12: the missing-comma problem has a sibling —
     * cashier admins are just as inconsistent about the *period* on a
     * middle initial or suffix as they are about the comma. "JUAN S. DELA
     * CRUZ" and "JUAN S DELA CRUZ" are the same person to a human, but the
     * Cashier API does exact string matching, so a dropped period is a
     * hard miss same as a dropped comma.
     *
     * Confirmed 2026-08-13: the suffix problem has a second sibling that
     * period-optional variants don't cover — the suffix's *slot*, not its
     * punctuation. A real OR was on file as "NONO JR., JOEGE C.", with
     * the suffix folded into the LAST name ("NONO JR.") rather than
     * appended to the given names. Every candidate before this fix put
     * the suffix after the middle initial, so a suffixed person could
     * never match regardless of how many punctuation variants existed.
     * Reproduced live against the Cashier API before landing this fix.
     *
     * Hyphenated names (2026-08-13, anticipated rather than yet observed
     * in a failure): a compound surname like "GARCIA-REYES" or a
     * hyphenated first name like "MARY-JOY" has the same free-text
     * problem as punctuation elsewhere — an admin may type the hyphen,
     * a space, or nothing at all. This adds separator variants for any
     * name part that actually contains a hyphen (zero cost when it
     * doesn't). Deliberately NOT included: candidates that drop one half
     * of a hyphenated name entirely (e.g. matching "GARCIA-REYES" against
     * just "GARCIA"). Separator guessing is safe because it's still
     * unambiguously the same name; dropping a component changes which
     * name is being searched for, and could match a different real
     * person's on-file record. For payment verification, a false match
     * is a worse failure than one more manual review, so that dimension
     * is intentionally left out rather than added later without thinking
     * it through — see also the class docblock on why any addition here
     * needs to weigh false-negative cost against false-positive risk.
     *
     * Each new variant dimension (punctuation, slot, order) is applied
     * only to the highest-priority format rather than cross-multiplied
     * across every existing candidate — a full cross product would push
     * the list into the dozens for the fraction of people who have both a
     * middle name and a suffix, and every extra candidate is one more
     * live API call before a genuinely bad OR gets rejected. See
     * MAX_CANDIDATES for the hard backstop on top of that discipline.
     *
