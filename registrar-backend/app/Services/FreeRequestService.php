/**
 * FESPEC-0008 — Free Document/Certificate Request.
 *
 * Backend for the admin Free Request page. Deliberately does NOT call
 * AuditLogger anywhere in this class — this codebase's established
 * convention (see DocumentRequestController/CashierOrOverrideController)
 * is that audit logging is a controller-layer concern, performed after
 * a service call succeeds, using the live Illuminate\Http\Request for
 * IP/user-agent. FreeRequestFilingResult carries everything the Phase 3
 * controller needs to write accurate, specific audit_log rows without
 * re-querying anything this class already computed.
 *
 * Originally scoped to "reuse NameMatcher for account matching" — that
 * turned out not to be buildable: NameMatcher generates name-string
 * variants to retry against the Cashier payment API for OR verification
 * and has nothing to do with looking up a registered account. This
 * class's searchAccounts() is the real, lightweight account lookup this
 * feature actually needs, built against student_profile / alumni_profile
 * directly (same query shape as CashierOrOverrideController::
 * searchUsers(), extended with the academic info the Free Request page
 * and FreeRequestEligibilityService both need to display/decide on).
 *
 * ── Concurrency: why the target user row is locked, not a partial index ──
 * Production runs MySQL, which does not support partial/filtered unique
 * indexes — see the 2026_09_04_000001_add_channel_to_document_request
 * migration's docblock. The one-free-copy-per-graduate guarantee is
 * instead enforced here: fileFreeRequest() locks the TARGET user's row
 * (`users`, via SystemUser::lockForUpdate()) for the duration of the
 * transaction, re-runs FreeRequestEligibilityService::checkMany() with
 * that lock held, and only then creates the request. Locking the target
 * user row (rather than any existing document_request row for them)
 * is deliberate: it is guaranteed to exist and be lockable even for a
 * graduate's very FIRST free request, when there is no prior
 * admin_filed_free row yet to lock. Two admins racing to file the same
 * graduate's first free TOR therefore serialize on this lock — the
 * second one re-evaluates eligibility against the first one's
 * now-committed request and correctly sees the limit already reached.
