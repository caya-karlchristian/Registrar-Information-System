/**
 * System-level analytics for the Super Admin role — deliberately separate
 * from AnalyticsService, which is scoped to a single Registrar's document
 * request queue (volume, processing time, staff performance). This service
 * answers a different question: "is the system itself healthy" — roster
 * state, delegated-access throughput, and cross-system verification health
 * — not "how is one queue of requests performing."
 *
 * Per the Analytics & Audit Log Revamp plan, Phase 2:
 *   - System-wide volume/trend is intentionally NOT duplicated here. It's
 *     the same shape as AnalyticsService::overview()/volumeTrend(), and
 *     Super Admin already has access to those endpoints (role:4 bypasses
 *     the role:3 route group via RoleMiddleware) — the frontend calls them
 *     directly rather than this service re-deriving the same numbers.
 *   - "Security posture snapshot" (failed logins, lockouts, IDP-unreachable
 *     count) is intentionally NOT included yet — it depends on the
 *     security_events table proposed in Phase 3, which has not been built.
 *     Add that panel here once Phase 3 lands; do not approximate it against
 *     audit_log in the meantime (that's the exact log-mixing problem Phase
 *     3's design write-up argues against).
