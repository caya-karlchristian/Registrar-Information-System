/**
 * Grants and revokes role_assignments rows — the entitlement layer that
 * sits alongside (not yet replacing) users.role_id. See
 * database/migrations/2026_08_10_000000_create_role_assignments_table.php
 * for why this table exists separately.
 *
 * grant() is how a "student staff" gets onboarded: the person already
 * has a Student role_assignment (from the backfill, or from
 * UserProvisioningService::provision() on their first SSO login), and a
 * Super Admin grants them a second, Admin role_assignment with a
 * restricted policy and a bounded expires_at.
 *
 * editPolicy() (Work Item #2) is the in-place counterpart to grant()/
 * revoke(): swapping the policy on an already-Active Admin grant without
 * needing a full revoke/regrant cycle (and the forced re-login that
 * revoke() intentionally causes for a real offboarding event).
 *
 * revoke() is the deterministic "they left" offboarding path — explicit,
 * audited, and immediately session-invalidating (see the token-revocation
 * note on revoke() below). The non-deterministic "they graduated" case
 * relies on expires_at + role-assignments:expire instead, since RIS has
 * no live signal for graduation (confirmed: student_academic_record has
 * no graduation_date column, and OGOS's DTO exposes no enrollment-status
 * field) — see Console\Commands\ExpireRoleAssignments.

     * SECURITY: revokes ALL of the user's active Sanctum tokens, not just
     * ones somehow tied to the revoked role — RIS sessions aren't
     * currently role-scoped at the token level (see AuthController /
     * SsoAuthService — every login issues one token for the account),
     * so a revoked-but-still-logged-in admin must be forced to
     * re-authenticate entirely, not just lose access to the specific
     * role client-side. This mirrors how a Deactivated account is
     * already treated (UserProvisioningService::provision() rejects it
     * outright on next login) — a revocation should take effect
     * immediately, not at the next natural token expiry.
     *
     * DELIBERATE GUARD: refuses to revoke a user's ONLY currently
     * Active assignment. RoleResolver::resolve() (and therefore every
     * login) always derives the account's role from the raw
     * users.role_id column, never from role_assignments — so revoking
     * someone's last remaining row would force one re-login (their
     * tokens get deleted) and then silently do nothing: they'd log
     * back in with the exact same access, because role_assignments was
     * never the thing gating it. That leaves a Revoked row on record
     * for an account that was never actually denied anything — exactly
     * the kind of state that misleads whoever reads the Roles tab
     * later. Ending ALL of someone's access is Layer 1's job
     * (deactivate the account — see AdminUserService::update() /
     * RoleAssignmentService::revokeAllForUser()), not Layer 2's;
     * revoke() here is specifically for offboarding ONE role off a
     * multi-role account while the rest of their access continues.
