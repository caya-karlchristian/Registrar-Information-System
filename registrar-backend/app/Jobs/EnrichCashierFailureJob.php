|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| EnrichCashierFailureJob (Phase 4 — Cashier Verification Failure Diagnostics)
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Dispatched from DocumentRequestController::verifyReceiptAgainstCashier()
| when a Cashier OR-verification attempt fails with reason NOT_FOUND (never
| on API_ERROR — that's the Cashier System's own availability, not a
| name/OR mismatch). Not dispatched inline in the request/response path: a
| student's failed submission is never delayed by an extra third-party call
| made purely for the registrar's later benefit — this runs on the queue
| worker (ShouldQueue, database driver — see config/queue.php), mirroring
| the existing SendBulkNotificationJob pattern.
|
| What it does: pulls a live snapshot of what OGOS (students) or the
| alumni system (alumni) currently has on file for the person who
| attempted the OR, and writes it as a NEW, separate audit_logs row —
| never a mutation of the original cashier_verification entry. See
| AuditLog::ACTION_CASHIER_VERIFICATION_ENRICHED's docblock for why an
| in-place metadata update was deliberately rejected in favor of a
| second, linked row (audit_logs is hash-chained and append-only by
| design — AuditLog::booted() enforces this at the model layer).
|
| Surfaced as raw data (on-file name vs. each candidate RIS tried) — not
| an auto-generated "fault" verdict, since name matching is inherently
| fuzzy (see NameMatcher's class docblock). By the time a registrar looks
| at this, OGOS/the alumni system's record may have already changed
| again; this snapshot is a point-in-time reference, not a live link.
