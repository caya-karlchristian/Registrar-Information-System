| ExpireRoleAssignments  (php artisan role-assignments:expire)
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sweeps any role_assignments row still 'Active' past its expires_at ->
| 'Expired', and force-revokes that account's Sanctum tokens the same
| way an explicit revoke() does (see RoleAssignmentService::revoke()) —
| an unrenewed grant should lose its session immediately at expiry, not
| linger until the token happens to lapse on its own.
|
| This is the safety net for offboarding scenarios RIS has no live
| signal for — most notably graduation: student_academic_record has no
| graduation_date column, and OGOS's DTO exposes no enrollment-status
| field (confirmed against the actual client/DTO), so RIS cannot detect
| "this student-staff member graduated" as an event. Time-boxing the
| grant at creation (RoleAssignmentService::grant()) and sweeping it
| here means an unrenewed assignment lapses on its own on schedule,
| rather than silently persisting past the person's actual tenure.
|
| Deliberate design note: this does NOT touch the account's OTHER role
| assignments. A student-staff member's expired Admin grant does not
| affect their Student assignment — offboarding one role should never
| collaterally offboard another the person still legitimately holds.
|
| Each expiry is audit-logged individually (not one bulk entry), same
| reasoning as ExpireStaleProvisioning: the audit trail should be able
| to answer "when did THIS specific assignment expire" without
| cross-referencing a batch job's timestamp.
