/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| PruneSecurityEvents
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Runs daily via the Laravel scheduler (see routes/console.php).
|
| Phase 3h — audit_logs stays untouched/permanent (its retention is a
| compliance decision outside this command's scope); only security_events
| is pruned, per config('security_events.retention_days').
|
| Uses a query-builder mass delete (SecurityEvent::where(...)->delete()),
| NOT a per-row $model->delete() loop. Two reasons:
|   1. Performance — one SQL statement instead of N round-trips for
|      what can be a high-volume table (see the plan doc's volume
|      concern re: "every bad password attempt, every bot scan").
|   2. Correctness — Eloquent mass deletes do not fire individual model
|      events, so SecurityEvent::booted()'s deleting-guard (which exists
|      specifically to block ad-hoc single-row deletes elsewhere in the
|      app) does not block this intentional, scheduled, bulk operation.
|      This is the "deletion allowed only via retention job" rule from
|      the plan, enforced structurally rather than via a bypass flag.
